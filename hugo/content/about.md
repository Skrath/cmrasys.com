I've always had a strong interest in both creative writing and computer programming. I'm sure most people might consider this an odd combination but it's never felt like that to me. They're both a way to express yourself using language. They both have grammar and syntax; a large hierarchy of complex rules; and a near-infinite number of possible permutations. You know, monkeys and typewriters and all that.

I've spent a good number of years doing programming/web development as a career and keeping most of the creative output as a hobby on the side. But that's incidental. Regardless of my vocation, I'll always be a writer and I'll always be a programmer.

So this is yet another iteration of my personal website. Endeavoring to show off some of the more polished corners of my often muddled mind. It's not the first version and I doubt it will be the last.

So, you know, enjoy.

Or fuck off. That's fine too.
