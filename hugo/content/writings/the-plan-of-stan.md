Stan’s the man from Pakistan,

Devised a plan to get with Anne

Involving flans, lambs, and highly polished jars of jam.

<!--more-->

Now Anne had planned to take a tram

From Istanbul to East Iran,

A reprieve from fam’, her land, and to ease her tired hands.

Now I hate to pan, understand,

But Stan did rand ‘bout his plan,

And he has not lambs, nor jam, or even a ticket for that tram.

Poor man, that Stan,

So uncertain was his plan,

What girl wants flans, jam, or other boxes of stolen contraband?

But trams be damned,

Stan had his plan,

So off he ran, flans in hand, striving to make one last stand.

And so Stan was rammed,

By a speeding tram, split like two strands,

I should have told Stan about Anne, she’s gay.
