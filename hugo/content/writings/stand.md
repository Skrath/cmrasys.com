I miss the stars.

I miss the darkness.

I miss the cold, the stillness, the peace.

I miss the air on my skin, and my breath thick in the breeze.

The peace in the isolation, the serenity lost in the night.

I miss their brightness, their clarity and reach.

I miss standing, alone in the dark, just staring at the sky, forgetting all the things I need to forget.

Just letting go, feeling the world, the same way now as it has always been.

Not having to study for a test, answer to a boss, fill out a form, or pay a bill.

But stopping, picking that moment, holding it, breathing the cold air, and just letting go.

Seeing the world not like a place where I live and do things, but simply as a place where I am.

I miss all that clarity, the simpleness.

It was a special kind of solitude.

Not the kind where you're lonely, but just a moment where all of the people and all of the things, take a break, step apart.

A pause for the world, for the sky.

A drink, simple and clear, without needless ambition or guilt, without anger or need.

I miss them, not because they are far away or hard to see.

But because they are always there, and I forget to look.
