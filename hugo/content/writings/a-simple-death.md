As I said once to the rotting dead of past,

What stories are told by lips of mold at last?

Battles and defeat, a wanton retreat, a stabbing cuirass?

Said He to I, “No, I died, so simple and crass.”

A love forlorn? A heart a torn perhaps? Suicide pact?

“Nay” said Him, to my chagrin, “I haven’t such tact.”

Then please, tell me, just how it be, your body’s cold?

“I lived, I loved, I fibbed, I got old.”
