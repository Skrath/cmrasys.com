OK! Looks like I've got the automated deployments working just fine now.

I'll be adding a bunch of old content that I've got mostly ready to go over the next few days. Most of it is *really* old and could use some revisions/edits. But for now, everyone will just have to deal with all the old crust and hard-water stains.

Updating the site is actually quite easy now so it would be nice to imagine that I might actually, you know, *update the site* from time to time...
